The Smallest REST API testing framework in 16 lines of code (#code16challenge)

Full description and road to achieve it is described in those 2 articles (writen in Polish):

* https://testerembyc.pl/posts/jeszcze-mniejszy-framework-do-testow-w-pythonie/

Branches with most interesting versions of the framework:

* [first article](https://github.com/mkusz/the_smallest_rest_api_testing_framework/tree/first_article) - 15 lines of code with limited functionality

* [only 6 lines of code](https://github.com/mkusz/the_smallest_rest_api_testing_framework/tree/6_lines) - same 
  functionality as in **first article**, but in a limited lines of a code
  
* [more functionality](https://github.com/mkusz/the_smallest_rest_api_testing_framework/tree/more_functionality) - 
  code with extended testing abilities but still in 16 lines of code
  
* [PEP-8 valid](https://github.com/mkusz/the_smallest_rest_api_testing_framework/tree/pep8_valid) - version that is valid with PEP-8 style coding guide, functionality is somewhere in between versions with **6 lines** of code and **more functionality** but still in 16 lines of c
